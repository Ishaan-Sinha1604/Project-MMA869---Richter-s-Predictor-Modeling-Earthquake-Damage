# Project-MMA869---Richter-s-Predictor-Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
Built a LightGBM model to predict the level of damage to any building if faced with a 7.8Mw earthquake. The data is collected from the Gorkha earthquake (Nepal) in 2015.

Built a LightGBM model in Python for predicting the level of damage to buildings in a situation like the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal that occurred in 2015. 
Achieved 67th rank in the competition, which is in the top 1.2% of the competition
Created pipelines for multiple algorithms such as CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and Logistic regression and compared them using 10-fold cross-validation scores
Performed Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search, Random Search, and Optunaâ€™s TPE search
